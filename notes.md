	- e.g. Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB)
- Content-based programs 
	- e.g. CBLT, CLIL, SIOP, 6Ts
- Aims, goals, objectives of programs

## Reading: Chapter 4, 5, Mohan(sp) handout

### Chapter 4

Syllabus
: What your gonna do

Outline
: How your gonna do it

- role of teachers and learners in course design
	- objectives

### Chapter 5: World English

- L2 English speakers often develop different styles of English (Singlish)
- What kind of english should you be teaching?
	- Focus on learner

## Lesson Plan Background

- Choose a guideline to assess (ie Richmond SD38)
	- Listening, speaking, reading, writing

### Proficiency Levels:

#### Contexts of ELL Teaching

- programs
- students background
	- levels of proficiency
		- CLB, CEFR, ACTFL

## [Mohans Knowledge Framework](http://tslater.public.iastate.edu/kf/framework.html)
 - An organizational tool that helps **teachers and students** to see knowledge structures -- the common patterns underlying the presentation of information
 - Making students aware of knowledge structures allows them to access to material at a much higher level than their linguistic ability would normally allow.
 - Topics of study or content or "activity" can be broken down into six structures of knowledge ("boxes") with associated thinking processes and language structures.

**On what is the approach based?**

- Knowledge structures can be used to plan the teaching of any topic at any grade level
- specific language tends to be applied to particular knowledge structures. Learners aware of these kinds of links are capable of learning both content and language more efficiently.
- Knowledge structures can be presented visually. Key visuals can be used in tasks as links between languages and content for the learner.

**How is it useful?**

- Integrates content and language
- fosters development of language skills
- fosters development of higher level thinking skills
- fosters transfer of learning across content areas

**Categories**:

1. Classifying
2. Explaining
3. Evaluating
4. Describing
5. Sequencing
6. Choosing

|What is it (being) | How does it work (doing) | Feeling 
|- |- |-
| Classifying | Explaining/Principles | Evaluation
| Describing | Sequencing | Choosing

``Each category has its own thinking skills, graphic organizers, and discourse structures``


## BICS vs CALP

| BICS | CALP
|-|-
| 1 - 2 years | 5-7 years
| Cognitively Undemanding | Cognitively Demanding
| Context embedded | Context reduced
| Learning & Teaching by doing | Learning & Teaching by teaching from lecture and textbook


---

| - | Low Cognitive Demand | High Cognitive Demand
|-|-|-
| **High Context** | I. (easiest) | III
| **Low Context** | II | IV (hardest)
